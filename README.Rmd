Need to get the USPS shipping zone between two zip codes? `usps` provides a tidy interface to the [USPS domestic zone calc API](https://postcalc.usps.com/DomesticZoneChart/). 

A zone is a [measure of distance](https://ribbs.usps.gov/zone_charts/documents/tech_guides/ZoneChartExceptionsWebinar.pdf) between the origin and the destination zip codes and are used in determining postage rates. 

### Installation 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('aedobbyn/usps')
```

### Usage

There are 99999^2 or `r 99999^2` possible origin-destination zip combinations. USPS narrows down that search space a bit by trimming it it to the first 3 digits of the zip.

Supply a 3-digit origin and, optionally, destination zip prefix to find their corresponding zone. If no destination is supplied, all desination zips and zones are returned for the origin.

```{r}
library(usps)

fetch_zones(origin_zip = "123", 
            destination_zip = "581")
```


<br>

#### Multiple zips

You can provide a vector of zips and map them nicely into a long dataframe. Here we ask for all destination zips for these three origin zips. 

If an origin zip is supplied that is [not in use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ZIP_code_prefixes), it is messaged and included in the output with `NA`s in the other columns. For example, the origin "001" is not a valid 3-digit zip.


```{r}
origin_zips <- c("001", "271", "828")

origin_zips %>% 
  purrr::map_dfr(fetch_zones)
```


Similarly, map over both origin and destination zips and end up at a dataframe. `verbose` gives you a play-by-play if you want it.

```{r}
dest_zips <- c("867", "53", "09")

purrr::map2_dfr(origin_zips, dest_zips, 
                fetch_zones,
                verbose = TRUE)
```

#### Ranges and other features

The USPS zone calc web interface displays zones only as they pertain to destination zip code *ranges*:

<p align="center">
  <img src="./man/figures/post_calc.jpg" alt="post_calc" width="70%">
</p>


<br>

If you prefer the range representation, you can set `as_range = TRUE`. Instead of a `dest_zip` column, you'll get a marker of the beginning of and end of the range in `dest_zip_start` and `dest_zip_end`.


```{r}
fetch_zones("42", "42",
            as_range = TRUE)
```


<br>


### Details

You can optionally display other details about the zips, zones, and type of postage it applies to.

Definitions of these details can be found in `detail_definitions`.

```{r}
detail_definitions %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

### On Digits

#### The Nitpicky

* Number of digits: 
    * This API endpoint used in `fetch_zones` accepts exactly 3 digits for the origin zip; it mostly returns 3 digit destination zips, but notes 5 digit exceptions. For that reason,
    * If fewer than three digits are supplied, leading zeroes are added with a message
    * If more than five digits are supplied, the zip is truncated to the first five with a warning
      * The first three digits of the origin zip are sent to the API
      * If destination and is 5 digits, `exact_destination` determines whether we filter to the 5-digit destination only or include results for the 3-digit destination prefix


```{r}
fetch_zones(origin_zip = "12358132134558", 
            destination_zip = "91442",
            show_details = TRUE)     
```

Consider as opposed to:

```{r}
fetch_zones(origin_zip = "12358132134558", 
            destination_zip = "91442",
            show_details = TRUE,
            exact_destination = TRUE)  
```


<br>

#### I just want to supply 5 digits

`fetch_zones` should cover most 5 digit cases and supply the most information when `show_details` is `TRUE`, but if you just want to use the equivalent of the ["Get Zone for ZIP Code Pair"](https://postcalc.usps.com/DomesticZoneChart/) tab, you can use `fetch_five_digit`.

```{r}
fetch_five_digit("31415", "92653",
                 show_details = TRUE)
```

Details in `fetch_five_digit` are slightly different than in `fetch_zones`.

### All of the data

If you want the most up-to-date zip-zone mappings, `fetch_all` allows you to use the 3 digit endpoint to fetch all possible origins and write them to a CSV as you go.

By default we use every possible origin from "000" to "999"; as of now "000" through "004" are all not in use.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
fetch_all(all_possible_origins,
          sleep_time = 0.5, 
          write_to = glue::glue(here::here("data", "{Sys.Date()}_all_my_zones.csv")))
```


If there's a network error, we back off and try a few times and finally write "no_success" (rather than `NA`s which indicate that the origin zip is not in use). What that looks like in the event we get internet between asking for origin "123" and origin "456": 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
tibble::tribble(
  ~"origin", ~"dest", ~"zip",
  "123", "no_success", "no_success",
  "456", "005", "4",
  "456", "006", "7",
  "456", "007", "7",
  "456", "008", "7",
  "456", "009", "7",
  "456", "010", "4",
  "...", "...", "..."
)
```
