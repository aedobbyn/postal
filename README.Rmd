# usps `r emo::ji("mailbox")`

Need to get the USPS shipping zone for two zip codes? `usps` provides a tidy interface to the [USPS zone calc API](https://postcalc.usps.com/DomesticZoneChart/).

### Installation Instructions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('aedobbyn/usps')
```

### Usage

Supply an origin and, optionally, a destination zip to find their corresponding zone.

```{r}
library(usps)

fetch_zones(origin_zip = "123", 
            destination_zip = "581")
```


#### Details

* If no destination is supplied, all desination zips and their zones are returned for the origin
* If an origin zip is supplied that is [not in use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ZIP_code_prefixes), it is messaged and included in the output with `NA`s in the other columns
* Number of digits: 
    * This API endpoint accepts exactly 3 digit origin zips; it mostly returns 3 digit destination zips, but notes 5 digit exceptions. For that reason,
    * If fewer than three digits are supplied, leading zeroes are added with a message
    * If more than five digits are supplied, the zip is truncated to the first five with a warning
      * The first three digits of the origin zip are sent to the API
      * If destination is supplied, we filter the results to the first 3 digits if `exact_destination` is `FALSE`; otherwise we return only the exact destination


```{r}
fetch_zones(origin_zip = "12358132134558", 
            destination_zip = "91442")     
```


<br>

#### Multiple zips

You can provide a vector of zips and map them nicely into a dataframe. Here we ask for all destination zips for these three origin zips. 

<!-- The origin "001" is not a valid 3-digit zip. -->


```{r}
origin_zips <- c("271", "8281828459", "045235")

origin_zips %>% 
  purrr::map_dfr(fetch_zones)
```


Similarly, map over both origin and destination zips and end up at a dataframe:

```{r}
dest_zips <- c("867", "53", "09")

purrr::map2_dfr(origin_zips, dest_zips, 
                fetch_zones,
                verbose = TRUE)
```

#### Ranges and other features

The USPS zone calc web interface displays zones only as they pertain to destination zip code *ranges*:

  <img src="./img/post_calc.jpg" alt="post_calc" width="70%">
</p>


<br>

If you prefer the range representation, you can set `as_range = TRUE`. Instead of a `dest_zip` column, you'll get a marker of the beginning of and end of the range range in `dest_zip_start` and `dest_zip_end`.

<br>


You can optionally display other details about the zips, zones, and type of postage it applies to.

```{r}
fetch_zones("42", "42",
            as_range = TRUE, 
            show_details = TRUE)
```

<br>

Definitions of these details can be found in `detail_definitions`.

```{r}
detail_definitions %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```


<br>

### 5 digits

`fetch_zones` should cover most 5 digit cases and supply the most information when `show_details` is `TRUE`, but if you just want to use the equivalent of the ["Get Zone for ZIP Code Pair"](https://postcalc.usps.com/DomesticZoneChart/) tab, you can use `fetch_five_digit`.

```{r}
fetch_five_digit("31415", "92653",
                 show_details = TRUE)
```
